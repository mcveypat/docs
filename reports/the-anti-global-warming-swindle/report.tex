\section{Introduction}
	- General stuff the documentary (director, broadcast) \\
	- The film is a criticism of the IPCC and current global warming hysteria \\
	- Attempts to prove the insignificance of CO2 in the atmosphere \\
	- Accuse the governments and the IPCC of killing development \\
\section{Global Warming in the 21st Century}
	- Brief overview of how global warming/greenhouse gases work\\
	- Radiation in gas molecules\\
\section{Arguments Presented}
	- Attempts to provide arguments...\\
\subsection{The Relevance of the Post Economic Boom}
	- Film shows the graph\\
	- What was/is the post economic boom\\
	- How has the film interpreted the graph/data\\
	- What is the correct way of interpreting the data\\
\subsection{Global Warming is Politics}	
	- Film claims the global warming industry is political\\
	- IPCC misrepresenting scientists\\
	- Can't substantiate the claims made by the film\\
\subsection{Temperature Leads $CO_2$}
	- Film claims that T leads CO2, not the other way around\\
	- Shows famous graph\\
	- How the film interprets the data\\
	- The correct way of interpreting the graph\\
	- Scientist explanation of graph\\
\subsection{The Insignificance of $CO_2$}
	- Film claims CO2 is not major factor in greenhouse gases\\
	- Ocean is much more significant\\
	- Sun (and sun spots) actually changes the temperature\\
	- Environment needs equilibrium\\
	- Simply wrong \\
\section{Solution Presented}
	- Film says funding for global warming research should be ceased\\
	- Also that people should stop caring and doing things to stop it\\
	- Simply wrong, based on the facts. The solution doesn't stand up\\
	- Best course of action is to keep researching in the global warming field and to work together to create a cleaner society.\\
\section{Conclusion}
	- The film fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims and solutions\\
	- The science seems to have been altered to provide seemingly convincing evidence to those not versed in the global warming field \\
	- A piece of propaganda \\
